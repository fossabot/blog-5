So I have decided to learn go and I figured I'd learn it on my long flight that I had this week.
So I figured what better way to learn it then try to convert a PHP script that I have to a go binary.
I figured that wouldn't be a bad way to learn. So I was able to make the go binary that pumps data into
a rabbitmq exchange. Only thing I have left to do is figured out how to conenct to a xmlrpc endpoint and authenticate
and make calls. So I was able to get 50% of the logic and working done.


### So Whats the code
So the code is very simple. I have to say I love how the code is so clean compared to other languages. So far I have been every impressed with go.

### Things I noticed
It has a pretty sharp learning curve. I wouldn't let this stop me from learning this language if I was new to programming.
